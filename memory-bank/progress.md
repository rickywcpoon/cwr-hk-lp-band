- [x] **Build verification**: All changes confirmed working. ✅

### **Phase 2: Layout Restructuring (Ongoing - Iterative)**
*Many planned Phase 2 items have been addressed through continuous iterative changes based on user feedback. The focus has shifted to refining the existing structure rather than a complete overhaul, aligning with the case-restoration reference as applicable.*

#### **Key Remaining/Ongoing Considerations for Layout**
- [ ] **Problem/Solution Section**: Ensure this clearly addresses customer pain points (current "Loose vs Right Fit" and parts of "Why Choose Us" contribute to this).
- [ ] **Trust Indicators**: Continuously ensure experience, expertise, and social proof are well-integrated.
- [ ] **Process Overview**: The `RestorationProcess` component exists; ensure its clarity and placement are optimal.
- [ ] **Style Alignment with Case-Restoration**: Continue to use as a visual and structural guide where appropriate.
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization**: Ongoing attention to touch targets, readability, and viewport optimization with each change.

### **Phase 3: Performance Monitoring & Final Optimization (Future)**

#### **Performance Measurement**
- [ ] **Add Lighthouse CI** - Automated performance monitoring.
- [ ] **LCP/FCP tracking** - Real user monitoring implementation.
- [ ] **Bundle analysis** - Identify and optimize heavy dependencies.

#### **Final Optimizations**
- [ ] **Critical CSS** - Inline above-the-fold styles.
- [ ] **Lazy loading** - Verify all non-critical, below-the-fold content is lazy-loaded.
- [ ] **Resource hints** - Preload critical assets.

## Current Status

**Phase 1 (Critical Performance Fixes) is complete.** The project is now in a phase of **ongoing styling and content enhancements**, with many elements of the originally planned "Phase 2: Layout Restructuring" being incorporated iteratively. The focus is on refining the existing structure and components based on user feedback and conversion goals, using the case-restoration site as a reference. All major initial performance issues have been addressed.

## Known Issues

- No major known code/build issues at present. Focus is on UI/UX refinement.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial setup**: Generic Next.js application with modern stack.
- **Context discovery**: Identified as conversion-focused landing page for watch band restoration.
- **Performance prioritization**: LCP <2.5s requirement drove initial technical decisions; now maintaining this standard.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Development has shifted to an iterative model, with styling and content changes made section-by-section based on direct user feedback and visual review.
- **User preferences incorporated**: WhatsApp widget logo updated, copy updates implemented as provided.
- **Reference alignment**: Case-restoration site styling consistency used as a guideline.
