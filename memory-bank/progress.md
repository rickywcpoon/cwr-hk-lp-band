# Project Progress

*This document tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.*

## What Works

*   Initial Memory Bank structure created.
*   Core technical details and system patterns documented in `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md` based on configuration file analysis.
*   Replaced "經典手錶維修" with "Classic Watch Repair" on the landing page (`app/page.tsx`).

## What's Left to Build (High-Level)

*   **Populate `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`:** These require understanding the project's purpose, goals, and user experience, which typically comes from user input or higher-level documentation.
*   **Detailed Codebase Analysis:** Dive deeper into `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, and `hooks/` to understand specific implementations, data flow, and refine system patterns if necessary.
*   (Further items to be determined by project scope)

## Current Status

*   Memory Bank initialized and populated with initial findings from configuration files.
*   Awaiting further direction or specific tasks to continue analysis or development.

## Known Issues

*   ESLint and TypeScript errors are ignored during builds (`next.config.mjs`).
*   Next.js image optimization is disabled (`next.config.mjs`).
    *These are not necessarily "issues" with the Memory Bank process but observations about the project itself that might be relevant.* 

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Decision to initialize Memory Bank as the first step based on custom instructions.
*   Prioritized analysis of configuration files (`package.json`, `next.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`) to quickly establish technical context and system patterns.
