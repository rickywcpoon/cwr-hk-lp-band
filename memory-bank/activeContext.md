- Ensure animations are GPU-accelerated where appropriate.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **CSS-Only Animations**: Chose CSS over JavaScript libraries (like Framer Motion) for better performance and smaller bundle size.
- **Intersection Observer Strategy**: Using single global observer vs individual component observers for better performance.
- **Animation Accessibility**: Ensuring animations respect user preferences and don't cause motion sickness.
- **Touch Interaction**: Added swipe support for mobile users to enhance process step navigation.
- **Performance vs. Polish**: Balancing visual appeal with loading speed and Core Web Vitals.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Staggered Animations**: 0.1-0.4s delays for sequential element reveals create natural flow.
- **Cubic-Bezier Easing**: Using `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)` for smooth, natural motion.
- **Scroll-Triggered Reveals**: Elements animate when 10% visible with 50px bottom margin for timing.
- **Hover State Consistency**: All interactive elements include hover feedback with consistent timing (0.3s).
- **Touch-First Mobile**: Swipe gestures complement button navigation for better mobile UX.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Transform and opacity animations for optimal performance.
- **Brand Color Integration**: Animation effects use casal color scheme for consistency.

## Learnings & Project Insights

- **Animation Performance**: CSS animations significantly outperform JavaScript libraries for simple transitions.
- **Intersection Observer**: Single global observer more efficient than multiple component-level observers.
- **Mobile Touch UX**: Swipe gestures feel more natural than button-only navigation on mobile devices.
- **Perceived Performance**: Well-timed animations make page feel faster even if load times are similar.
- **Animation Hierarchy**: Staggered reveals guide user attention naturally through content flow.
- **Accessibility Considerations**: Motion preferences and reduced motion settings crucial for inclusive design.
- **Bundle Size Impact**: Removing Framer Motion dependency reduced JavaScript bundle significantly.
