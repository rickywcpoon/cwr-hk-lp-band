# Active Context

*This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions and considerations, important patterns and preferences, learnings, and project insights.*

## Current Work Focus

*   Completed initial codebase analysis and population of Memory Bank files (`techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`).

## Recent Changes

*   Created `memory-bank` directory.
*   Initialized `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
*   Analyzed `package.json`, `next.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and `tsconfig.json`.
*   Updated `techContext.md` with detailed technical stack, dependencies, and setup information.
*   Updated `systemPatterns.md` with architecture overview, key decisions, and design patterns.
*   Replaced "經典手錶維修" with "Classic Watch Repair" on the landing page (`app/page.tsx`).

## Next Steps

*   Review the populated Memory Bank files for accuracy and completeness.
*   Awaiting further user instructions or tasks. If the project's purpose is known, `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` can be updated.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   The project uses Next.js with the App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, likely with Shadcn/UI for components.
*   ESLint and TypeScript errors are ignored during builds, which is a point to be mindful of.
*   Next.js image optimization is disabled.

## Important Patterns & Preferences (from Custom Instructions)

*   Memory Bank is crucial due to session memory resets.
*   Must read ALL Memory Bank files at the start of EVERY task.
*   Follow specific structure and content guidelines for Memory Bank files.
*   Hierarchical relationship between Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md` is foundational).
*   Specific workflows for updating Memory Bank (Act Mode, Plan Mode).

## Learnings & Project Insights

*   The project is a modern Next.js application with a strong emphasis on utility-first CSS and a component-based architecture, likely leveraging the Shadcn/UI ecosystem.
*   The configuration files (`next.config.mjs`) indicate some non-standard build settings (ignoring errors, unoptimized images) that might need further investigation depending on the project goals.
