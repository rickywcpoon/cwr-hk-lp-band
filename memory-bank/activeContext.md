## Next Steps

### **Final Styling & Content Review (Current Focus)**
- Review all sections for final polish and consistency.
- Address any remaining minor UI tweaks or copy adjustments.

### **Phase 2: Layout Restructuring (Priority 2 - Largely complete through iterative changes)**
- While not a full "phase 2" overhaul, many layout and content changes have been made iteratively, aligning closer to the case-restoration reference.
- Further structural changes can be considered if needed for conversion.

### **Phase 3: Performance Monitoring (Priority 3)**
1. **Add performance measurement** - LCP/FCP tracking implementation.
2. **Bundle optimization** - Minimize JavaScript bundles.
3. **Critical CSS implementation** - Above-the-fold optimization.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Copy handled iteratively**: User provides copy updates section by section, implemented as received.
- **Case-restoration reference**: Style consistency with https://case-restoration.classicwatchrepair.com/ continues to be a guideline.
- **Performance non-negotiable**: LCP <2.5s must be achieved and maintained.
- **Mobile-first approach**: Primary ad traffic source optimization.
- **Brand consistency**: Must align with Classic Watch Repair's established visual identity.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Performance-first decisions**: Every change evaluated against LCP target.
- **Conversion-focused layout**: Section flow optimized for WhatsApp contact conversion.
- **Static generation preferred**: Minimize client-side JavaScript where possible.

- **Iterative development**: Changes are made section by section based on user feedback.
